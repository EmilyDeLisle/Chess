# Chess

Chess is an Object-Oriented Programming project I did in term 2 of the Computer Systems Technology program at BCIT.
    
The goal was to utilize the OOP principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to recreate Chess using Java. The secondary goal was to use serialization to enable saving and loading game data, restoring the game to a previously-saved state. The graphical user interface is made using the JavaFX library.

For demonstrations and images of the application in action, please visit my portfolio at [emilydelisle.ca](https://emilydelisle.ca).
